# ATM MIT
## Description
As in a real ATM, in this project I made a simple interface to let the user deposit funds to his account and withdraw only the ammount of money that he/she had already enter and just in the US Dolars bills available.

## Technologies and dependencies: 
This project use `react`in a standalone version so you don't need to install any packages, just need VS code or another code editor
## How to run:

- Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffrenAnthony/ATMMIT
```
- Install http-server

```bash
npm i --global http-server
```

- Go to your terminal and place in the directory of the project and run

```bash
http-server -c-1
```

- Navigate to localhost:8080 on your browser

- To quit the server just press Cmd or Ctrl + c in your terminal.

## Roadmap of future improves

- Add an stock of every bill in the bank
